<POI Id="Law" DisplayName="Law Building">
   <Address>1822 East Mall, Vancouver, BC</Address>
   <Lat>49.269041</Lat>
   <Long>49.269041</Long>
   <Description>LEED Gold certification. Renovating the old building would have cost four-fifths the amount to construct a new building. In contrast to the Chemistry Centre, UBC decided to construct a new law building instead of renovating -- each project is evaluated individually to determine what is best environmentally, economically and socially. The Faculty of Law outgrew the old building so now they will enjoy state-of-the-art teaching and research spaces that promote legal discussions and student engagement.</Description>
