Task M1
-------

AutoBus can be substituted for type Bus because, according to LSP, both methods that are
overridden have equal or weaker preconditions and have stronger or equal postconditions.



Task M6
-------
a) It will fail when the method throws a DoorException or a MotionException
b) It must go through the entire method without throwing either of the above exceptions
c) It is not possible to replace because it has the potential of throwing an acceptable
RampException


Task M7
-------
In the context of Substitutability, the postcondition
should have a stronger restriction in the subtype than
the superclass. If the subclass throws more checked exceptions
that means that it is accepting greater number of errors to occur
or in other words, relaxing the previous restriction made in
the superclass.


Task M8
--------

1. 
a) 3
b)5
c) 6
d)4
e)1
f)1
g)5
